# End to end project

* Start from the "Churn" dataset
* apply basic feature engineering

  * Convert categorical variable to numeric
  * Standardation
* Apply a RNN model
* Calculate loss and optimizer (with Keras and Tensorflow)


## Setup
First of all setup the python environment, from the terminal:
```
conda create -p venv python=3.10
conda activate ./venv
```

Then install the python packages in the virtual environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
