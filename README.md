# genai
Generative AI python experiments: using Langchain and other tools to create summary, translate from one language to another, chatbot, virtual agents that answer using pdfs as knowledge base, ...and more... (se the "u" folders below).

**Prerequisites:**
* [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) package manager. Tha is used to create virtual environments, including selecting the python version
* Python basic understanding
* A "Python editor", for example [Visual Studio Code](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://code.visualstudio.com/&ved=2ahUKEwiju82RyJiJAxXW2wIHHQSPGwcQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw15O90sm1ios8AUpw56hCml)

The code is organized in 7 folders (u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7), each of them is a specific topic.

## u1
Introduce pre-requisites and basic concepts like tokenization, stop words, bag of words, word2vect.

## u2
Keras project of a prediction model.

## u3
Keras project to predict the word, training an RNN model from some sentences of the Hamlet.

## u4
## u5
## u6
## u7
